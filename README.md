## Flux

    `GitOps` leverages Git as the single source of truth to define every part of a cloud-native system. `Flux`is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux v2 is constructed with theÂ GitOps Toolkit, a set of composable APIs and specialized tools for building Continuous Delivery on top of Kubernetes.



Please follow [cnp-flux-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config) for documentation as both repos use `Flux` tool.
